This HTML code creates a page to calculate compound interest. Compound jurors are a fundamental financial concept in which the gains or costs are calculated not only on the initial value but also on the interest accrued in previous periods. Here is a brief explanation of the main parts of the design:

1. Initial (Principal) Value: The initial value of the investment or loan.
2. Interest Rate: The interest rate applied to the initial amount, usually on an annual basis.
3. Monthly Amount (or Annual Addition): Any additional contributions or withdrawals made over time.
4. Period: The time in which the investment is interrupted, usually in years.

The calculation of compound interest is done iteratively, with interest being calculated on the total balance, including interest accrued in previous periods. This form allows the user to enter these values ​​and then calculate the total result after the specified period.

For more information about compound interest and how it is calculated, see the links provided in the navigation links at the top of the page.
